# vim: ft=dosini

# Configfile for qutebrowser.
#
# This configfile is parsed by python's configparser in extended interpolation
# mode. The format is very INI-like, so there are categories like [general]
# with "key = value"-pairs.
#
# Comments start with ; or # and may only start at the beginning of a line.
#
# Interpolation looks like  ${value}  or  ${section:value} and will be replaced
# by the respective value.
#
# This is the default config, so if you want to remove anything from here (as
# opposed to change/add), for example a keybinding, set it to an empty value.

[general]
# show_completion: bool, whether to show the autocompletion window or not.
# ignorecase: bool, whether to do case-insensitive searching.
# wrapsearch: bool, whether to wrap search to the top when arriving at the end.
# startpage: The default pages to open at the start, multiple pages can be
#            separated with commas.
# auto_search: Whether to start a search automatically when something
#              which is not an url is entered.
#                 true/naive: Use simple/naive check
#                 dns:        Use DNS matching (might be slow)
#                 false:      Never search automatically

#                many tabs open.
# position: Position of the tab bar, either north, south, east or west.
# select_on_remove: Which tab to select when the focused tab is removed. Either
#                   'previous', 'left' or 'right'.
# last_close; Behavour when the last tab is closed - 'ignore' (don't do
#             anything), 'blank' (load about:blank) or 'quit' (quit

[searchengines]
# Definitions of search engines which can be used via the address bar.
# The searchengine named DEFAULT is used when general.auto_search is true and
# something else than an URL was entered to be opened.
# Other search engines can be used via the bang-syntax, e.g.
# "qutebrowser !google". The string "{}" will be replaced by the search term,
# use "{{" and "}}" for literal {/} signs.

[keybind]
# Bindings from a key(chain) to a command. For special keys (can't be part of a
# keychain), enclose them in @-signs. For modifiers, you can use either - or +
# as delimiters, and these names:
#   Control: Control, Ctrl
#   Meta:    Meta, Windows, Mod4
#   Alt:     Alt, Mod1
#   Shift:   Shift
# For simple keys (no @ signs), a capital letter means the key is pressed with
# Shift. For modifier keys (with @ signs), you need to explicitely add "Shift-"
# to match a key pressed with shift.
# You can bind multiple commands by separating them with ";;".
