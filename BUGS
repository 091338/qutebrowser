Crashes
=======

- When following a hint:

  QNetworkReplyImplPrivate::error: Internal problem, this method must only be called once.

- When enabling javascript on http://google.com/accounts and reloading:

    OpenType support missing for script 12

  Then it quits.
  When javascript is enabled already, hangs.
  With minimal browser, prints error but continues to run.

  Also quits on http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallo-Welt-Programm

  It seems this only happens on Windows.

- Closing some tabs and undo all them -> quits and CMD.exe hangs

    QHttpNetworkConnectionPrivate::_q_hostLookupFinished could not dequeu request

- Clicking the blank area of the grey titlebar of the webinspector closed
  qutebrowser on windows

Bugs
====

- All kind of FIXMEs

- When opening DDG the input field should be focused when JS is active, but
  only is sometimes. (seir)

- restart sometimes abort()s on QApplication __init__ (V155)

- qutebrowser :restart loops endlessly
    We should refuse to do :restart when executing init commands

- Super key shows up as áŸ€\udc53  in logs

- Funky font rendering with tewi:
  http://a.pomf.se/ecgzlx.png

- F on duckduckgo result page opens in current page

  It seems we don't get a linkClicked signal there.
  Maybe it does some weird js stuff?

- Shutdown is still flaky.

  Some pointers:
      https://code.google.com/p/webscraping/source/browse/webkit.py
      Simply does setPage(None) in __del__ of webview.

      http://www.tenox.net/out/wrp11-qt.py
      does del self._window; del self._view; del self._page

      http://pydoc.net/Python/grab/0.4.5/ghost.ghost/
      does webview.close(); del self.manager; del self.page; del self.mainframe

- Eliding doesn't work correctly in tabs (cuts off start)
  This especially happens when there's no favicon
  (will be solved by tabbar reimplementation)

- Opening via commandline / startpage doesn't work with absolute file paths.

- Relative file paths and ~ don't work at all.

- scroll_page doesn't care about always visible bars, so content gets hidden
  e.g. http://www.mtb-news.de/forum/t/welcher-schuh-five-ten-vs-oneal.529148/

- Config errors on start shouldn't be hard errors
  (e.g. when an user-stylesheet file is deleted)

- Clicking links/email in crash dialog should open browser/mailclient under
  windows

- ok is always True in WebPage:on_load_status_changed, even when an error page
  is loaded.

- When tabbar -> scroll-buttons is disabled and there are too many tabs, the
  window has a bigger size hint instead of tabs getting smaller than the
  minimum size (iggy)
