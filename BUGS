Crashes
=======

- Segfault when opening an SSL page and then switching the tab to a non-SSL
  page.

  This happens because we don't filter the ssl_errors command correctly per tab
  and then re-emit it for the wrong tab which doesn't even use SSL.

  Will be fixed by using a QNetworkAccessManager per tab again, which is a good
  idea (for per-tab-proxy) anyways.

- When following a hint:

  QNetworkReplyImplPrivate::error: Internal problem, this method must only be called once.

- When enabling javascript on http://google.com/accounts and reloading:

    OpenType support missing for script 12

  Then it quits.
  When javascript is enabled already, hangs.
  With minimal browser, prints error but continues to run.

  Also quits on http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallo-Welt-Programm

  It seems this only happens on Windows.

- Closing some tabs and undo all them -> quits and CMD.exe hangs

    QHttpNetworkConnectionPrivate::_q_hostLookupFinished could not dequeu request

- Clicking the blank area of the grey titlebar of the webinspector closed
  qutebrowser on windows

Bugs
====

- All kind of FIXMEs

- When opening DDG the input field should be focused when JS is active, but
  only is sometimes. (seir)

- When opening 111.111.111.111 sometimes there's no loading bar and link in
  statusbar points to the old page. (seir)

- Current URL displayed in the statusbar is weird and sometimes wrong (seir)

- restart sometimes abort()s on QApplication __init__ (V155)

- qutebrowser :restart loops endlessly
    We should refuse to do :restart when executing init commands

- Super key shows up as áŸ€\udc53  in logs

- Funky font rendering with tewi:
  http://a.pomf.se/ecgzlx.png

- F on duckduckgo result page opens in current page

  It seems we don't get a linkClicked signal there.
  Maybe it does some weird js stuff?

- Shutdown is still flaky.

  Some pointers:
      https://code.google.com/p/webscraping/source/browse/webkit.py
      Simply does setPage(None) in __del__ of webview.

      http://www.tenox.net/out/wrp11-qt.py
      does del self._window; del self._view; del self._page

      http://pydoc.net/Python/grab/0.4.5/ghost.ghost/
      does webview.close(); del self.manager; del self.page; del self.mainframe

- Eliding doesn't work correctly in tabs (cuts off start)
  This especially happens when there's no favicon
  (will be solved by tabbar reimplementation)

- Opening via commandline / startpage doesn't work with absolute file paths.

- Relative file paths and ~ don't work at all.

- Pasting highlighted text (to mrxvt) does not work (iggy).

- scroll_page doesn't care about always visible bars, so content gets hidden
  e.g. http://www.mtb-news.de/forum/t/welcher-schuh-five-ten-vs-oneal.529148/

- Command history seems to be broken

- Config errors on start shouldn't be hard errors
  (e.g. when an user-stylesheet file is deleted)
