- Prevent invalid filenames (e.g. com1) when downloading on Windows

- Auto-insert-mode sometimes doesn't work correctly

- Sidewise scrolling via mousewheel broken

- Space-scrolling sometimes broken until clicking into page

- foo@bar:baz.com  is handled as search term

- Handle it correctly when a new statusbar question is asked while another is
  still active. (see notes)

- Ugly font rendering on Windows on http://support.sigasi.com/Knowledgebase/List

- On doodle, when modifying something on http://doodle.com/create and clicking
  a link to leave the page, the message is suboptimal. Also, with some random
  clicking it's somehow possible to get out of yesno mode.

- Segfaults when trying to load http://cmpl.cc/downloads/hlwm-tablet.mkv and
  with youtube HTML5 player.

- When quitting while being asked for a download filename: segfault / memory
  corruption

- When following a hint:

  QNetworkReplyImplPrivate::error: Internal problem, this method must only be called once.

- Closing some tabs and undo all them -> quits and CMD.exe hangs

    QHttpNetworkConnectionPrivate::_q_hostLookupFinished could not dequeu request

- All kind of FIXMEs

- restart sometimes abort()s on QApplication __init__ (V155)

- Super key shows up as áŸ€\udc53  in logs

- Funky font rendering with tewi:
  http://a.pomf.se/ecgzlx.png

- F on duckduckgo result page opens in current page

  It seems we don't get a linkClicked signal there.
  Maybe it does some weird js stuff?

- Shutdown is still flaky. (see notes)

- Eliding doesn't work correctly in tabs (cuts off start)
  This especially happens when there's no favicon
  (will be solved by tabbar reimplementation)

- Opening via commandline / startpage doesn't work with absolute file paths.

- Relative file paths and ~ don't work at all.

- scroll_page doesn't care about always visible bars, so content gets hidden
  e.g. http://www.mtb-news.de/forum/t/welcher-schuh-five-ten-vs-oneal.529148/

- Config errors on start shouldn't be hard errors
  (e.g. when an user-stylesheet file is deleted)

- Clicking links/email in crash dialog should open browser/mailclient under
  windows

- ok is always True in WebPage:on_load_status_changed, even when an error page
  is loaded.

- When tabbar -> scroll-buttons is disabled and there are too many tabs, the
  window has a bigger size hint instead of tabs getting smaller than the
  minimum size (iggy)
