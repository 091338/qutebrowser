- Downloading albums on imgur gives us corrupt files!

- Concept of "current URL" should work better before urlChanged is emitted,
  e.g. loading a page and immediately yanking the (non-resolved) URL should
  work.

- When setting tabbar -> expand to true on xmonad (?), the window expands
  continously:

  egan │ Sorry, what I mean is that the length of the tab starts at a specific
  size and grows to the right continually.

  egan │ In fact the web page rendered in the tab also scrolls in that
  direction until it is no longer visible

  egan │ This is accompanied by high CPU usage

- Weird bugs when editing default keybindings:

  egan │ posativ: No. It appears a little more complicated that that too. It
  reverts some of my mappings to the default and some of them it duplicates so
  that the default calls the same command as my mapping.

  egan │ For the most part it seems like editing the default keybindings is
  dysfunctional at this point. Some of my bindings are kept, but most are
  reverted, duplicated, or just wrong (i.e. a key I bound to one command gets
  rebound to a different command to which it was not originally bound).

  egan │ The last part makes me think of an off-by-one error in lists. I'll
  take a look at the code and see if I can see anything.

- tabbar -> close-on-right-click is broken

- seir sometimes sees "-- COMMAND MODE --" even though that should never
  happen.

- Shift-Insert in commandline pastes clipboard instead of primary selection

- Hint positions wrong in wordpress admin interface

- download-page on qute:htmllog is broken

- Downloads: "connection closed" if user takes too long

- Download focus rectangle on windows

- Rightclick -> Copy link copies relative links

- Prevent invalid filenames (e.g. com1) when downloading on Windows

- Auto-insert-mode sometimes doesn't work correctly

- Sidewise scrolling via mousewheel broken

- Space-scrolling sometimes broken until clicking into page

- Ugly font rendering on Windows on http://support.sigasi.com/Knowledgebase/List

- On doodle, when modifying something on http://doodle.com/create and clicking
  a link to leave the page, the message is suboptimal. Also, with some random
  clicking it's somehow possible to get out of yesno mode.

- Segfaults when trying to load http://cmpl.cc/downloads/hlwm-tablet.mkv and
  with youtube HTML5 player.

- When quitting while being asked for a download filename: segfault / memory
  corruption

- When following a hint:

  QNetworkReplyImplPrivate::error: Internal problem, this method must only be called once.

- Closing some tabs and undo all them -> quits and CMD.exe hangs

    QHttpNetworkConnectionPrivate::_q_hostLookupFinished could not dequeu request

- All kind of FIXMEs

- restart sometimes abort()s on QApplication __init__ (V155)

- Funky font rendering with tewi:
  http://a.pomf.se/ecgzlx.png

- F on duckduckgo result page opens in current page

  It seems we don't get a linkClicked signal there.
  Maybe it does some weird js stuff?

- Shutdown is still flaky. (see notes)

- Eliding doesn't work correctly in tabs (cuts off start)
  This especially happens when there's no favicon
  (will be solved by tabbar reimplementation)

- Opening via commandline / startpage doesn't work with absolute file paths.

- Relative file paths and ~ don't work at all.

- scroll_page doesn't care about always visible bars, so content gets hidden
  e.g. http://www.mtb-news.de/forum/t/welcher-schuh-five-ten-vs-oneal.529148/

- Config errors on start shouldn't be hard errors
  (e.g. when an user-stylesheet file is deleted)

- Clicking links/email in crash dialog should open browser/mailclient under
  windows

- ok is always True in WebPage:on_load_status_changed, even when an error page
  is loaded.

- When tabbar -> scroll-buttons is disabled and there are too many tabs, the
  window has a bigger size hint instead of tabs getting smaller than the
  minimum size (iggy)

- Segfault on subsonic when clicking next track

- Assertion failure on subsonic with debug build

- Random error messages while browsing on imgur/reddit:

  WARNING: content-type missing in HTTP POST, defaulting to
  application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Use QNetworkRequest::setHeader() to fix
  this problem.

  WARNING: QXcbWindow: Unhandled client message: "_GTK_LOAD_ICONTHEMES"

  INFO: Lexer rewriter used, but no tokens found.

  WARNING: QIODevice::read: device not open
