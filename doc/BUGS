- Downloading albums on imgur gives us corrupt files!

- Concept of "current URL" should work better before urlChanged is emitted,
  e.g. loading a page and immediately yanking the (non-resolved) URL should
  work.

- seir sometimes sees "-- COMMAND MODE --" even though that should never
  happen.

- Shift-Insert in commandline pastes clipboard instead of primary selection

- Hint positions wrong in wordpress admin interface

- download-page on qute:htmllog is broken

- Downloads: "connection closed" if user takes too long

- Download focus rectangle on windows

- Rightclick -> Copy link copies relative links

- Prevent invalid filenames (e.g. com1) when downloading on Windows

- Auto-insert-mode sometimes doesn't work correctly

- Sidewise scrolling via mousewheel broken

- Space-scrolling sometimes broken until clicking into page

- Ugly font rendering on Windows on http://support.sigasi.com/Knowledgebase/List

- On doodle, when modifying something on http://doodle.com/create and clicking
  a link to leave the page, the message is suboptimal. Also, with some random
  clicking it's somehow possible to get out of yesno mode.

- Segfaults when trying to load http://cmpl.cc/downloads/hlwm-tablet.mkv and
  with youtube HTML5 player.

- When quitting while being asked for a download filename: segfault / memory
  corruption

- When following a hint:

  QNetworkReplyImplPrivate::error: Internal problem, this method must only be called once.

- Closing some tabs and undo all them -> quits and CMD.exe hangs

    QHttpNetworkConnectionPrivate::_q_hostLookupFinished could not dequeu request

- All kind of FIXMEs

- restart sometimes abort()s on QApplication __init__ (V155)

- Funky font rendering with tewi:
  http://a.pomf.se/ecgzlx.png

- F on duckduckgo result page opens in current page

  It seems we don't get a linkClicked signal there.
  Maybe it does some weird js stuff?

- Shutdown is still flaky. (see notes)

- Opening via commandline / startpage doesn't work with absolute file paths.

- Relative file paths and ~ don't work at all.

- scroll_page doesn't care about always visible bars, so content gets hidden
  e.g. http://www.mtb-news.de/forum/t/welcher-schuh-five-ten-vs-oneal.529148/

- Config errors on start shouldn't be hard errors
  (e.g. when an user-stylesheet file is deleted)

- Clicking links/email in crash dialog should open browser/mailclient under
  windows

- ok is always True in WebPage:on_load_status_changed, even when an error page
  is loaded (probably *because* we're loading the error page and that
  succeeds).

- Opening editor is broken on http://p.cmpl.cc/

- Segfault on subsonic when clicking next track

- Assertion failure on subsonic with debug build

- Random error messages while browsing on imgur/reddit:

  WARNING: content-type missing in HTTP POST, defaulting to
  application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Use QNetworkRequest::setHeader() to fix
  this problem.

  WARNING: QXcbWindow: Unhandled client message: "_GTK_LOAD_ICONTHEMES"

  INFO: Lexer rewriter used, but no tokens found.

  WARNING: QIODevice::read: device not open

- Random error message when closing/re-opening tab:

  WARNING: Type conversion already registered from type QSharedPointer<QNetworkSession> to type QObject*

- Scrolling lags like crazy (even in minimal browser) on
