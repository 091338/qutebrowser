Bugs
====

Downloads
---------

- Downloading albums on imgur gives us corrupt files!
- "connection closed" if user takes too long
- Download focus rectangle on windows
- download-page on qute:htmllog is broken
- Prevent invalid filenames (e.g. com1) when downloading on Windows
- With a large file, when setting filename after buffer is full, download
  hangs.

Webview
-------

- F on duckduckgo result page opens in current page

  It seems we don't get a linkClicked signal there.
  Maybe it does some weird js stuff?

  Asked here: http://stackoverflow.com/q/23498666/2085149

- scroll_page doesn't care about always visible bars, so content gets hidden
  e.g. http://www.mtb-news.de/forum/t/welcher-schuh-five-ten-vs-oneal.529148/
- ok is always True in WebPage:on_load_status_changed, even when an error page
  is loaded (probably *because* we're loading the error page and that
  succeeds).
- Opening editor is broken on http://p.cmpl.cc/ (probably a CodeMirror issue?)
- Middle-clicking anchors doesn't actually move to the anchor in the new tab
- lots of "Element vanished" warnings on
  http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/pillar.html when
  clicking

Input
-----

- going to passthrough mode (Ctrl-V) then clicking element to go to insert
  mode, then leaving insert mode clears statusbar text.
- seir sometimes sees "-- COMMAND MODE --" even though that should never
  happen.
- Shift-Insert in commandline pastes clipboard instead of primary selection
- Auto-insert-mode sometimes doesn't work correctly (e.g. login form of Gitlab)
- Sidewise scrolling via mousewheel broken

Rendering
---------

- Ugly font rendering on Windows on http://support.sigasi.com/Knowledgebase/List
- Funky font rendering with tewi: http://a.pomf.se/ecgzlx.png

Crashes
-------

- Segfaults when trying to load http://cmpl.cc/downloads/hlwm-tablet.mkv and
  with youtube HTML5 player.
- Segfault on subsonic when clicking next track
- Segfaults when exiting while prompt is showing

- Hang on http://abcnews.go.com/Business/us-s/story?id=18230346 when video
  starts playing.
- Random hangs in windows (look at memory dumps)

- Assertion failure on subsonic with debug build
- Assertion failure when clicking on "doc" with debug build on qutebrowser
  github page

Qt warnings
-----------

- Random error messages while browsing on imgur/reddit:

  WARNING: content-type missing in HTTP POST, defaulting to
  application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Use QNetworkRequest::setHeader() to fix
  this problem.

  WARNING: QXcbWindow: Unhandled client message: "_GTK_LOAD_ICONTHEMES"

  WARNING: QIODevice::read: device not open

- Random error message when closing/re-opening tab:

  WARNING: Type conversion already registered from type QSharedPointer<QNetworkSession> to type QObject*

Misc
----

- All kind of FIXMEs
- On doodle, when modifying something on http://doodle.com/create and clicking
  a link to leave the page, with some random clicking it's somehow possible to
  get out of yesno mode. (probably fixed?)
- Config errors on start shouldn't be hard errors
  (e.g. when an user-stylesheet file is deleted)
- Clicking links/email in crash dialog should open browser/mailclient under
  windows
- Current font handling is rather broken (rejecting invalid values / setting
  multiple font families) - we should use PyPEG2 instead.
- On first start: KeyError because geometry couldn't be read logged as WARNING.
- tabs don't redraw properly when changing font
