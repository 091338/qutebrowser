== Style conventions ==

As you might have noticed, I *really* like clean and consistent code. While I
won't reject your contribution when you don't follow the guidelines, I'd be
really glad if you'd do so.

qutebrowser's coding conventions are based on [PEP8][1] and [PEP257][2], with
some additions:

    - Methods overriding Qt methods (obviously!) don't follow the naming
      schemes.

    - Everything else does though, even slots.

    - The layout of a module should be like this:

      ...

    - The layout of a class should be like this:

      ...
